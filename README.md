### Hey what's going on ðŸ‘‹

I am a mostly self taught python coder with a background in engineering/business working on data analytics, bots and dashboards.

I am using Github to host some of the work that I've done the past few years for myself (use this repo).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a database of historical listing distributions for nfts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning catboost regression.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data eng/analysis, bots in the sports or crypto space.
