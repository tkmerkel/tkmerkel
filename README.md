### Hey what's going on ðŸ‘‹

I am a mostly self taught python coder with a background in engineering/business working on data analytics, bots and dashboards.

I am using Github to host some of the work that I've done the past few years for myself (use this repo).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Dash app to explore different prompts for DALLE 2 | Midjournery.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data eng/analysis.
